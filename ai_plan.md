     - Aggregate data per floor: number of requests, delays.
     - Include time-based features capturing worker and student availability.
   - **Encoding:** Convert categorical data (e.g., grievance types, staff departments, hostel names) into numerical formats using techniques like One-Hot Encoding or Label Encoding to facilitate model training.

3. **Model Selection**
   
   - **Reinforcement Learning (RL):** Utilizes RL algorithms to optimize the assignment strategy based on rewards (e.g., reduced resolution time). RL is suitable for dynamic environments where the system can learn optimal policies through interactions.
     - **Advantages:**
       - Capable of handling sequential decision-making processes.
       - Learns from the consequences of actions, allowing for continuous improvement.
     - **Use Case Justification:** Ideal for scenarios where assignments need to adapt based on real-time feedback and evolving conditions.
   
   - **Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM):** Implements models like Weighted Sum Model (WSM) or Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) to evaluate multiple factors influencing assignments.
     - **Advantages:**
       - Transparent decision-making process with easily interpretable weights for each criterion.
       - Suitable for environments where decision factors are well-defined and static.
     - **Use Case Justification:** Effective when prioritizing multiple, potentially conflicting criteria is essential, and interpretability of the decision process is required.
   
   - **Comparison and Selection Logic:**
     - **RL** is preferred when the system benefits from learning and adapting over time with continuous feedback.
     - **MCDM** is advantageous for its simplicity and clarity in scenarios with well-established criteria and limited need for adaptability.

4. **Training the Model**
   - **Reinforcement Learning:**
     - Define the environment with states (current assignments, staff status, floor metrics) and actions (assignment decisions).
     - Implement reward functions based on resolution efficiency, reduced delays, and satisfaction metrics.
     - Train using algorithms like Q-Learning or Deep Q-Networks (DQN) which are effective for handling high-dimensional state spaces.
   
   - **MCDM:**
     - Assign weights to different criteria based on their importance through expert input or statistical methods.
     - Train the model using historical assignment data to optimize weight configurations, ensuring that the most critical factors influence decision-making appropriately.

5. **Model Evaluation**
   - **Metrics:** Resolution time, assignment accuracy, staff utilization rates, floor-specific delay reductions, and user satisfaction scores.
   - **Cross-Validation:** Apply techniques like k-fold cross-validation to ensure model robustness and prevent overfitting.
   - **Benchmarking:** Compare model performance against baseline methods (e.g., random assignment or rule-based systems) to quantify improvements.

6. **Deployment**
   - Integrate the trained model into the backend server using scalable frameworks (e.g., TensorFlow Serving, FastAPI).
   - Develop RESTful APIs for real-time grievance assignment, ensuring low latency and high availability.

6. **Deployment**
   - **Integration:** Embed the trained recommendation model into the backend server using scalable frameworks (e.g., TensorFlow Serving, FastAPI).
   - **API Development:** Create RESTful APIs that handle job assignment requests, ensuring real-time recommendations with minimal latency.
   - **Monitoring:** Implement monitoring tools (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana) to track model performance and system health, triggering alerts for any deviations.
   - **Retraining Schedule:** Establish periodic retraining intervals using new assignment data to keep the model updated and maintain recommendation accuracy.

7. **Monitoring and Maintenance**
   - **Performance Monitoring:** Continuously monitor model performance metrics to detect any degradation or shifts in data distribution.
   - **Threshold Adjustment:** Adjust detection thresholds as needed based on feedback and changing data patterns to maintain optimal sensitivity.
   - **Feedback Integration:** Incorporate feedback from administrators to refine anomaly definitions and improve model accuracy.
